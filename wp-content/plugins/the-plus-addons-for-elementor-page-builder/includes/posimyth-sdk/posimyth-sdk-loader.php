/**
 * POSIMYTH Analytics SDK — version-aware loader.
 *
 * Every POSIMYTH plugin ships its own copy of the shared SDK classes, each wrapped in a
 * class_exists guard. That guard alone made load ORDER decide the winner: whichever plugin
 * WordPress happened to include first defined Posimyth_Tracker_Base for everyone, so one outdated
 * sibling could silently downgrade the whole suite — e.g. an older do_request() without the
 * $bypass_consent parameter swallowed the deactivation survey's third argument and its feedback
 * never sent, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * So no plugin requires the shared classes directly any more. Each one calls
 * posimyth_sdk_register() with its bundled copy's directory; at plugins_loaded priority 0 — before
 * every consumer, which runs at priority 10 — the loader requires the files from the NEWEST
 * registered copy, as declared by that copy's version.php. Per-product subclasses are not shared
 * and are loaded by their own plugin after the winner exists.
 *
 * The loader itself must stay tiny and boring: it is duplicated into every plugin too, and only
 * the first copy's functions define. Change it only in a backwards-compatible way.
 *
 * @package POSIMYTH\Analytics\SDK
